/* (Savings Account Class) Create class SavingsAccount.
Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate for all account holders.

Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savingsBalance indicating
the amount the saver currently has on deposit.

 Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the savingsBalance
 by annualInterestRate divided by 12,

  this interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that
  sets the annualInterestRate to a new value.

 Write a program to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2,
  with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively.

 Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for both savers.
 Then set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next month's interest and print the new balances for both savers.
